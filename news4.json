      "description": "It has been quite a few years I am coding. Many times we get old or partial code to continue. I realised that it is very difficult to work with such codes as mostly we don't have any contacts with the earlier devs who worked on them. In such cases, I do miss all UML diagrams which we earlier read in colleges (class diagrams, sequence diagrams, deployment diagrams..) and sometimes we do scribble them while dev-huddles but mostly erase them. So just a thought - Won't it be great if there are tools to maintain UMLs with code and especially if with auto-sync option? ",
